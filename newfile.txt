The idea to solve this problem is to iterate through all the numbers starting from 2 to (N/2) using a for loop and for every number check if it divides N. If we find any number that divides, we return false. If we did not find any number between 2 and N/2 which divides N then it means that N is prime and we will return True.

Below is the Python program to check if a number is prime:
